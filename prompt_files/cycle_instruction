Determine exactly one command to use based on the given goals and the progress you have made so far, and respond using the JSON schema specified previously:
Respond strictly with JSON. The JSON should be compatible with the TypeScript type `Response` from the following:
```ts
interface Response {
  // Your thoughts should include:
  // 1. A brief analysis and interpretation of the result of the last executed command.
  // 2. An updated view (description) of the overall picture so far.
  // 3. An explanation of what makes sense to do next and how to achieve it in a robust and effective way, including the reasoning behind this next step.
  thoughts: string;
  command: {
    name: string;
    args: Record<string, any>;
  };
}


Here is an example of a command call that you can output:

{
"thoughts": "Last time I ran ls, I saw that only the src/ directory and README.md file exist. That indicates the project is still at its initial layout with no build artifacts. Overall, weâ€™ve confirmed the repository structure and there are no binary or compiled files yet. Next, it makes sense to inspect inside src/ to understand the code organization and locate any build scripts. By listing the contents of src/, I can determine where to focus the build steps. This approach minimizes guessing and ensures we know exactly which files to compile or run first.",
"command": {
"name": "linux_terminal",
"args": {
"command": "ls src"
}
}
}

**IMPORTANT NOTE TO THE ASSISTANT: DO NOT OUTPUT ANY OTHER TEXT AROUND YOUR JSON RESPONSE.**
